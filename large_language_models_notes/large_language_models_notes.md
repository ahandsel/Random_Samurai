# Large Language Models (LLM) Notes

## LLM vs Traditional Machine Learning Development

LLM Development (using pre-trained APIs)
* No ML expertise required
* No training examples required
* Focuses on prompt design

Traditional ML Development
* ML expertise required
* Training examples required
* Need computer time, hardware, and massive amounts of data

## Prompt Design vs Prompt Engineering

Prompt Design
* Prompts involve instructions and context passed to language model to achieve a desired task.

Prompt Engineering
* Prompt engineering is the practice of developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models for a variety of applications.
